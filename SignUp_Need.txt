Map Database table with class Name 
Define Database Structure


DB table   -----   Model Name
admin   ---------   admin   (if db table and model not use the singular and puler like emp --- emp then in this we need to do some mannual config)
devlopers --------  devlopers




--> php artisan config:Cache ((Laravel Store Cache So we try to re configure)
--> php artisan migrate ( To Sync with databse)


--> php artisan make:migration create_table_name_table ((For Creating the table and defining schema of it we are using this command))
> Database> Migration

Now we have created the table and form the structure or schema of table
--> lets migrate the table

--> php artisan migrate

--> to rollback 
-->php artisan migrate:rollback (To goto the previous state)
--> php artisan migrate:refresh (For creating syn or refresing)  --> first delete all the tables then again it will create

--> to add the columns
php artisan make:migration add_columns_to_tableName_table (like => add_columns_to_admin_table) 



----> Model
--> Models are class based php files.
--> Object Relational Mapper (It gives the querry function like insert, select, delete updata, join etc etc )
---> Each table have there own 'Model' that is used to interact with that specific table


-->> How to create Model?
php artisan make:model <Model_Name> (Like Admin --> intail char should be capital becoz its going to make an class)

>app> Models

Now we need to map that admin table with this

If WE NEED TO CREATE THE MIGRATION ALSO AT THE SAME TIME OF CREATING MODELS
--> We can do it by the help of 
php artisan make:model <ModelName> --migration  //So, it will create the model file also and also create the migration file



Insert Querry (By using ORM)

--> Create an Controller than import model




 DB::insert('insert into admin (name,email,jobid,username,password,teamkey,discription) values (?, ?,?,?,?,?,?)',
            [$req['name'],$req['email'],$req['jobid'],$req['username'],$req['password'],$req['teamkey'],$req['disc']]);




///We have Compeleted Up the Login Admin And Capturing Data of Admin
// We did one thing that is LogOut which is working fine but if one time we get logout then again try to access that link /admin/dashboard which giving is rendring to that route even without loging and manny var not geting value so also throwing errors Now if we need to do some thing in such a way that an user if logout and trying access that specific link without login then not able to access that linke

// So, we can able to resolve this error by the help of middleware lets create it.

--> php artisan make:middleware AuthCheck --> This middleware not allow any user to access that route without login :)
--> Now register in kernal.php

--> Now to apply that AuthCheck we need to First Group All the pages then able to do that
Route :: group(['middleware'=>['AuthCheck']],function(){

});
->Now Moove all the pages which you wants to protect
